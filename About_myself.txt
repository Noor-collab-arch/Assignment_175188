My name is Noor Hussain, and I am a dedicated student with a deep interest in emerging technologies.
I'm 26 years old and i belong to Faislabad located in province Punjab.
I have always been curious about how technology shapes our world.
Recently, I developed a keen interest in generative artificial intelligence.
This field fascinates me because it combines creativity and technology in unique ways.
I am eager to learn how generative AI can create art, music, and even write stories.
I completed my inter in 2014 with  FSC Pre_engineering from Punjab group of colleges.
Then i got admitted in University of agriculture Faisalabad and completed my bachelors in infromation technology in 2018.
